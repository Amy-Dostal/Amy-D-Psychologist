                        Hi, my name is Amy and I’m a registered psychologist working in Bentleigh East. <br>
                        <br>
                        I work with adults aged 18+ for a variety of concerns, including depression, anxiety, and OCD. I’ve previously worked in hospital outpatient clinics, community mental health, and university counselling centres. I’m also undertaking the clinical psychology registrar program. <br>
                        <br>
                        The people I see often come into their first session feeling down or anxious, overwhelmed by unwanted thoughts, stuck in the same patterns, or dissatisfied with their life. They may be experiencing difficulties in their work, study, or relationships. Most of all, they are often struggling to understand why they are experiencing these difficulties or what they can do to overcome them. <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="bio-sub-title">Treatment Approach</span>
                        <br>
                        I'm passionate about helping people achieve a greater understanding of themselves and their patterns, to develop new ways of coping with difficult thoughts or emotions, and to start taking steps toward the life that they want. My approach is informed by evidence-based treatments, including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Schema Therapy, Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). <br>
                        <br>
                        Mostly, I aim to provide a relaxed space where people can feel comfortable, accepted, and safe to share things that can be hard to speak about elsewhere. I value working with people from a variety of cultural and religious backgrounds, and I tailor each person's treatment to ensure their needs, preferences, and feedback are incorporated into the sessions. <br>
                        <br>

                Last updated: 30 November 2024<br>
                <br>
                This document describes the privacy policy of Amy Dostal (Psychologist) for the management of clients’ personal information. The psychological service provided is bound by the legal requirements of the Australian Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). <br>
                <br> 
                <span class="priv-bold">Client information </span><br>
                <br>
                Client files are stored digitally using an encrypted, password-protected, online practice management software Halaxy. With the software, the data is backed up daily and protected by bank grade security and encryption in Australia, meaning that the data is secure at rest and in transit (where they are only accessible via TLS/SSL). The data is stored safely in Australia. Paper documents are scanned to Halaxy and shredded within 24 hours. If paper records are required to be transported between locations, they are transported in a locked document bag. Halaxy and the paper records are accessible only to Amy Dostal, or authorised employees or any authorised service provider in accordance with the practice's policies and procedures. The information on each file includes personal information such as name, address, contact phone numbers, medical history, and other personal information collected as part of providing the psychological service. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="priv-bold">How clients' personal information is collected </span><br>
                <br>
                A client's personal information is collected in a number of ways during psychological consultation with Amy Dostal, including when the client provides information directly to Amy Dostal using hardcopy forms, correspondence via email, when the client interacts directly with the employees of the organisations that Amy Dostal sub-contracts to, and when other health practitioners provide personal information to Amy Dostal, via referrals, correspondence and medical reports. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="priv-bold">Consequence of not providing personal information </span><br>
                <br>
                If the client does not wish for their personal information to be collected in a way anticipated by this Privacy Policy, Amy Dostal may not be in a position to provide the psychological service to the client. In some circumstances, clients may request to be anonymous or to use a pseudonym, unless it is impracticable for Amy Dostal to deal with the client or if Amy Dostal is required or authorised by law to deal with identified individuals. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="priv-bold">Purpose of holding personal information </span><br>
                <br>
                A client’s personal information is gathered and used for the purpose of providing psychological services, which includes assessing, diagnosing and treating a client’s presenting issue. The personal information is retained in order to document what happens during sessions, and enables the psychologist to provide a relevant and informed psychological service. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="priv-bold">Disclosure of personal information </span><br>
                <br>
                Clients’ personal information will remain confidential except when: <br>
                <br>
                <ol class="priv-list">
                    <li>it is subpoenaed by a court, or disclosure is otherwise required or authorised by law;</li>
                    <li>failure to disclose the information would in the reasonable belief of Amy Dostal place a client or another person at serious risk to life, health or safety; or</li>
                    <li>the client’s prior approval has been obtained to:</li>
                    <ol class="priv-list2">
                        <li>provide a written report to another agency or professional, e.g., a GP or a lawyer; or</li>
                        <li>discuss the material with another person, e.g. a parent, employer, health provider, or third party funder; or</li>
                        <li>disclose the information in another way; or</li>
                        <li>disclose to another professional or agency (e.g. your GP) and
                            disclosure of your personal information to that third party is for a purpose which is directly related to the primary purpose for which your personal information was collected.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
                <br>
                A client's personal information is not disclosed to overseas recipients, unless the client consents or such disclosure is otherwise required by law. Clients' personal information will not be used, sold, rented or disclosed for any other purpose. <br>
                <br>
                In the event that unauthorised access, disclosure or loss of a client’s personal information occurs Amy Dostal will activate her data breach plan and use all reasonable endeavours to minimise any risk of consequential serious harm. <br>
                <br> 
                <span class="priv-bold">Requests for access and correction to client information </span><br>
                <br>
                At any stage clients may request to see and correct the personal information about them kept on file. The psychologist may discuss the contents with them and/or give them a copy, subject to the exceptions in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). If satisfied that personal information is inaccurate, out of date or incomplete, reasonable steps will be taken in the circumstances to ensure that this information is corrected. All requests by clients for access to or correction of personal information held about them should be lodged with Amy Dostal. These requests will be responded to in writing within 30 days, and an appointment will be made if necessary for clarification purposes. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="priv-bold">Concerns </span><br>
                <br>
                If clients have a concern about the management of their personal information, they may inform Amy Dostal. Upon request they can obtain a copy of the Australian Privacy Principles, which describe their rights and how their personal information should be handled. Ultimately, if clients wish to lodge a formal complaint about the use of, disclosure of, or access to, their personal information, they may do so with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner by phone on 1300 363 992, online at https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-complaints/lodge-a-privacy-complaint-with-us or by post to: <br>
